# Ink Inventory/Journal Example
A basic inventory/journal implementation using the [Ink language](https://github.com/inkle/ink) for interactive narrative

This is a basic example of how to implement an inventory/journal system using Ink.

It uses tunnels to create a re-usable inventory/journal knot that you can call from any location in your story.
